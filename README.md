Machine Learning - Linear Regression the project on the Ecommerce Customers Device usage by using the datasets of Customers.

This project is done interpret the time usage of the customers in app and website. For how much time length the customers use the devices? 

We use Python Language for the code:
Importing the following models such as:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. OS
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
6. Linear Regression 
7. Metrics

We use the following formulas in Linear Regression:
1. Mean Absolute Error
2. Mean Squared Error
3. Root Mean Squared Error

The project is divided into sections:
1. Get the data
2. Exploring Data Analysis
3. Training and Testing data
4. Predicting Test Data 
5. Evaluating the model
6. Residuals
7. Conclusion

This the overview of the Project.
